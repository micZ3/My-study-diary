#2023 1 9 Today is January 9th, 2023
I exercise every two days,as usual,
I ran and then did kettlebell exercises and, 
of course, push-ups and sit-ups
I have gained a lot of weight,
I think that is why I practiced dumbbells and kettlebells
 Because I have never weighed this much,
 It is really  fuking too heavy for me
 ok, this is swear word I learned today😁
 I can't say it which is so hard to hear🤮
 I uploaded to my github,I just read the git doc yesterday
 I an no longer afraid of losing what I wrote
 hahha😎

 Today the snow melted
 The snow fell the day before yesterday,
 the road was slippery yesterday,
 and I was lazy,so I did't exercise.hahha😎
 I did more exercise than the previous few times😁
 I feel like I'm in good shape today😁
 Hope I can continue the exercise
 I ate a lot of small oranges,
 very delicious🤤
