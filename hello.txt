#2023 1 9 Today is January 9th, 2023
I exercise every two days,as usual,
I ran and then did kettlebell exercises and, 
of course, push-ups and sit-ups
I have gained a lot of weight,
I think that is why I practiced dumbbells and kettlebells
 Because I have never weighed this much,
 It is really  fuking too heavy for me
 ok, this is swear word I learned today😁
 I can't say it which is so hard to hear🤮
 I uploaded to my github,I just read the git doc yesterday
 I an no longer afraid of losing what I wrote
 hahha😎

 the road was slippery yesterday,

 Hope I can continue the exercise
